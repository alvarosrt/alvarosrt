  - I like to think that I can work in something I love. I don't work to get rich, but to become a complete and functional person. I'm self-taught, and the IT world has changed my life. Being able to continually learn and apply new skills is incredibly fulfilling. I believe that pursuing my passions and interests is more rewarding than any financial gain.
